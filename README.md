# Hi there! I'm Michael Solovyev

I'm a software engineer with a background in molecular biology. While working in scientific research, I discovered my passion for computational methods and programming. Now, I'm pursuing a Master's degree in Software Engineering and developing various projects spanning automation, data processing/visualisation, and interactive entertainment.

## My Projects
- **[play_zonk_bot](https://github.com/a17sol/play_zonk_bot)** â€“ A Telegram bot that hosts multiplayer Zonk (Farkle) games in group chats. A live instance of the bot is available [here](https://t.me/play_zonk_bot).
- **[ProHiC](https://github.com/a17sol/ProHiC)** â€“ A cross-platform Python-based application for data visualisation in 3D-genomics with unique features. Has been used in real research (e.g. [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.30.439615v1.full)).
- **[GM-machine](https://github.com/a17sol/GM-machine)** â€“ A custom AppScript solution for automating DnD-like game sessions management, making it convenient for players and game masters both.

## Open-Source Contributions
- Successfully contributed to [pyqtgraph](https://github.com/pyqtgraph/pyqtgraph) - powerful scientific data visualisation tool.
- Looking forward to engaging in more open-source collaborations
